          <p class="title">About me:</p>
          <p>I'm a bilingual, multicultural journalist, passionate about using data and graphics to tell compelling stories and engage readers. As such, I've enjoyed working with amazing teams at the Los Angeles Times and Univision Noticias.</p>
          <p>I've created data visualizations for breaking news and in-depth projects and have a track record of successful collaborations with reporters and colleagues. While at Univision Noticias, I contributed to award-winning pieces on femicides in Puerto Rico, the risks of vaping for youth, and Black and Latino women fighting evictions.</p>
          <p>My individual and team-based work has been recognized with multiple awards, including honors from the Radio Television Digital News Association (Edward. R Murrow Award), the NPPA (Portfolio/Visual Presentation Award), the Society of News Design (Excellence), and the Society of Professional Journalists - Sunshine State Awards.</p>
          <p>Before working as a data and graphics journalist, I was a local multimedia reporter covering the Latino community at Al Día/The Dallas Morning News. Our project on migrant kids from El Salvador won a First Amendment Award from the Society of Professional Journalists in Dallas-Fort Worth. It was also a finalist for an 'Ñ Award' from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.</p>
          <p>My journalism career started as an intern at El Nacional, my hometown newspaper, in Caracas, Venezuela, where I eventually became a staff writer and later joined the newspaper's investigative unit.
            I moved to the U.S. to pursue master's degrees in International Affairs and Journalism at Columbia University. I was also a fellow at the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism. I live in Florida with my husband, two kids, and our puppy, <a target="_blank" class="dotted_link"
