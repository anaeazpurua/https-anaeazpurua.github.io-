          <p>I'm a freelance bilingual data and graphics journalist with over a decade of experience covering the Latino
            community in the USA. Previously, as part of Univision Noticias' Graphics team, I was responsible for
            creating charts, maps, and other data visualizations. Our work was recognized with multiple awards,
            including honors from the Radio Television Digital News Association (Edward. R Murrow Award), the NPPA
            (Portfolio/Visual Presentation Award), the Society of News Design (Excellence), and the Society of
            Professional Journalists - Sunshine State Awards. </p><br>
          <p>Before that, I was a local multimedia reporter with Al Día/The Dallas Morning News, covering the Latino
            community. Our special project on migrant kids from El Salvador won a First Amendment Award from the Society
            of Professional Journalists (Dallas-Fort Worth).</p><br>
          <p> I began my journalism career in Caracas, Venezuela, as an intern at my hometown newspaper, El Nacional,
            where I eventually became a staff writer. My coverage included the dismantling of the country's foreign
            service with the arrival of the Chavista government. Later, I joined the newspaper's investigative unit.</p>
          <br>
          <p> I hold master's degrees in International Affairs and Journalism from Columbia University, where I was a
            fellow at the Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism. I live in Florida with my husband,
            9-year-old twins, and our puppy,<a target="_blank" class="dotted_link"
